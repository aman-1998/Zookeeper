# Zookeeper Concepts:
ZooKeeper is an open-source distributed coordination service designed to manage and coordinate large, distributed applications. 
It provides essential services like configuration management, synchronization, and distributed naming, enabling distributed applications 
to function smoothly by handling critical coordination tasks.

## Key Features of Apache ZooKeeper:
<ol>
  <li><b>Centralized Coordination:</b> Acts as a centralized repository for managing distributed applications.</li>
  <li><b>High Availability:</b> Supports a replicated, fault-tolerant architecture for reliability.</li>
  <li><b>Atomicity:</b> Ensures that updates to data are atomic.</li>
  <li><b>Sequential Consistency:</b> Guarantees order consistency for client updates.</li>
  <li><b>Eventual Consistency:</b> Allows all nodes to eventually synchronize.</li>
  <li><b>Watch Mechanism:</b> Provides a notification system for clients to subscribe to changes in the data.</li>
</ol>

## Typical Use Cases:
<ol>
<li><b>Distributed Locking:</b> Implements locks for resource coordination among distributed systems.</li>
<li><b>Leader Election:</b> Helps select a leader in distributed systems.</li>
<li><b>Configuration Management:</b> Stores configuration data for applications in a centralized way.</li>
<li><b>Service Discovery:</b> Maintains the location and availability of services.</li>
<li><b>Queue Management:</b> Manages distributed task queues.</li>
</ol>

## ZooKeeper Data Model:
ZooKeeper uses a hierarchical namespace similar to a file system:

<ul>
  <li> ZNodes: The fundamental entities in ZooKeeper, akin to directories or files in a file system.</li>
  <ul>
    <li type="disc"> Ephemeral ZNodes: Exist only as long as the session with the client is active.</li>
    <li type="disc">Persistent ZNodes: Remain until explicitly deleted.</li>
    <li type="disc">Sequential ZNodes: Have unique, sequential identifiers appended to their names. (Can be Persistent or Ephemeral)</li>
  </ul>  
</ul>

## Architecture:
ZooKeeper operates in a replicated architecture with the following roles:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Leader:</b> Handles all write requests and synchronizes updates with followers.</li>
  <li><b>Followers:</b> Handle read requests and participate in consensus (e.g., Paxos or Zab protocol).</li>
  <li><b>Clients:</b> Applications or systems interacting with ZooKeeper for coordination.</li>
</ul>

## Benefits:
<ul>
  <li>Simplifies the development of distributed applications.</li>
  <li>Ensures reliable and consistent coordination.</li>
  <li>Handles challenges like partial failures and synchronization in distributed environments.</li>
</ul>
  
## Integration:
ZooKeeper is widely used in technologies like:
<ul>
  <li>Apache Kafka (to maintain broker metadata and consumer group offsets).</li>
  <li>For coordination between brokers in the cluster of ActiveMQ Artemis</li>
  <li>Apache Hadoop and HBase (for resource coordination).</li>
  <li>Apache Storm and other distributed systems.</li>
</ul>
